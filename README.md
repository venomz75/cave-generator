# proceduralGenTest

This project is an implementation of a [random walk generation](http://roguebasin.com/index.php/Random_Walk_Cave_Generation) algorithm used to generate a cave like level.

While simple, the algorithm guarantees that the level is fully traversible as well as generating a believably random cave layout.
